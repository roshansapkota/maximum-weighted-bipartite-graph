# maximum-weighted-bipartite-graph
Generating weighted bipartite graph and print  the maximal weight of matching vertices using ILP.

A function MyBipartiteGraph(N) is created to generate a random bipartite graph. Random edges with random weights are created. Aanother function TestBipartiteGraph(G) to checks if the generated graph G is bipartite or not. Finally, Integer Linear Program (ILP) is created for solving the maximum weighted bipartite problem.
