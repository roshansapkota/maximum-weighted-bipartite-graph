# maximum-weighted-bipartite-graph
Generating weighted bipartite graph and print  the maximal weight of matching vertices using ILP.

A function MyBipartiteGraph(N) is created to generate a random bipartite graph. Edges and weights are also randomly generated. Aanother function TestBipartiteGraph(G) is created to checks if the generated graph G is bipartite or not. Finally, Integer Linear Program (ILP) is used to solve the maximum weighted bipartite problem.
